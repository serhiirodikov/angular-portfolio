        My name is Serhii and i'm a Front-end Developer. I recently successfuly
        passed IT interview and received an invitation to IT Academy by
        SoftServe as a front-end developer, I gained experience of working in
        this area. I am keen to gain more experience in the field. For this
        reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among
        their developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a
        pleasant and friendly addition to your team. Now i'm looking for a job
